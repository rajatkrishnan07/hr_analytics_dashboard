## Problem Statement

This HR Analytics Dashboard aims to provide insights into various HR metrics to help the HR department of a company make informed decisions. By analyzing employee data, the dashboard assists in understanding employee satisfaction, performance, and retention. It allows HR managers to identify areas of improvement, monitor key performance indicators, and make strategic decisions to optimize workforce management.


### Steps followed 

    Step 1: Handle Missing Values
 •Identify columns with missing values using summary statistics or visualization techniques.

•	Decide on the appropriate strategy for handling missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).

•	Use Power Query Editor in Power BI Desktop to filter out or replace missing values based on the chosen strategy.


    Step 2: Remove Duplicates
•	Identify duplicate records by checking for identical rows or key columns.

•	Remove duplicate records using Power Query Editor by deduplicating based on selected columns.

•	Verify that duplicate records have been successfully removed to ensure data integrity.


    Step 3: Standardize Formats
 •	Identify columns with inconsistent formats (e.g., date formats, categorical variables).

•	Standardize date formats using date parsing functions or transformations.

•	Standardize categorical variables by ensuring consistent naming conventions or encoding categorical values.

•	Use Power Query Editor to apply format standardization transformations across relevant columns.


    Step 4: Data Validation
•	Validate data consistency by checking for anomalies or unexpected values.

•	Verify numerical ranges, date ranges, and other constraints to ensure data accuracy.

•	Correct any data anomalies or errors found during validation using appropriate data cleaning techniques.


    Step 5: Address Outliers

•	Identify outliers using statistical methods (e.g., box plots, z-scores) or visual inspection.

•	Decide on the appropriate treatment for outliers (e.g., removal, transformation, winsorization).

•	Apply outlier treatment methods using Power Query Editor or DAX expressions as needed.

•	Verify the effectiveness of outlier treatment and ensure that data distribution is within acceptable bounds.


### Data Visualization

    Step 1: Choose appropriate visualizations

•	Determine the key insights and messages to be communicated through visualizations.

•	Select suitable visualizations based on the nature of the data (e.g., trends, comparisons, distributions).

•	Choose from a variety of visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, heatmaps, and tables.


    Step 2: Design Interactive Dashboards

•	Design an intuitive layout for the dashboard with clear navigation and organization.

•	Incorporate interactive elements such as slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities for exploring data dynamically.

•	Ensure consistency in design and layout across different dashboard pages or sections.

    Step 3: Implement Tooltips and Annotations

•	Include tooltips to provide additional context and details on data points when hovered over.

•	Use annotations to highlight important insights or trends within visualizations.

•	Customize tooltips and annotations to enhance the user experience and aid interpretation.

    Step 4: Ensure Accessibility and Clarity

•	Ensure that visualizations are accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments, by following accessibility guidelines.

•	Use clear and concise labels, titles, and legends to enhance understanding and readability.

•	Optimize visualizations for clarity and simplicity, avoiding clutter and unnecessary complexity.


    Step 5: Incorporate Branding and Styling

•	Apply consistent branding elements such as company logos, colors, and fonts to the dashboard.

•	Use themes and styles to maintain a visually appealing and professional appearance.

•	Regularly review and update the dashboard design to align with branding guidelines and user preferences.


By following these detailed steps for data cleaning and data visualization, you can create a robust and insightful HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI. Each step contributes to ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and effective communication of key HR metrics and insights.
